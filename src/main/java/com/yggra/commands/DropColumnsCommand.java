/**
 * Represents a DROP COLUMNS operation in YggraDB.
 * This command is forged during SQL parsing when the user issues a statement like:
 *     REMOVE FROM TABLE <tableName> (<col1>, <col2>, ...);
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Holds the list of column names destined for removal.
 *  - Holds the target table name.
 *  - Serves as a payload for execution by the DatabaseManager.
 * This is a simple, immutable data container â€” no execution logic here.
 * Execution happens in the SQLExecutor/command dispatch phase.
