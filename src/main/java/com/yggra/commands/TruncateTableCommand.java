 * This is no mere mortal deletion. It is the reset of an entire realm‚Äôs history,
 * called forth by the TRUNCATE TABLE ritual in the SQL scroll.
 * Example invocation in the scroll:
 *   TRUNCATE TABLE Valhalla;
 * The Bifrost of logic shall carry this command to the execution halls,
 * where the realm shall be purged in the blink of Odin‚Äôs eye.
