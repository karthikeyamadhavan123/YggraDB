## 🛡️ **Security - The Aegis of Yggdrasil**

YggraDB doesn't just prevent SQL injection - it **dramatizes** the protection:

```sql
-- Malicious attempt detected:
CREATE TABLE '; DROP DATABASE Valhalla;--'; 
-- 🔥 [FLAMES OF SURTR] Forbidden runes detected in table name!
-- 🛡️ [HEIMDALL'S WATCH] The Rainbow Bridge shields against dark magic!
-- ⚔️ The realms remain unbreached by your sorcery!

-- Another dark attempt:
INSERT INTO Warriors VALUES (1, 'Loki', 85.5); DROP TABLE Warriors;
-- 🌪️ [LOKI'S CHAOS] Multiple commands detected - chaos magic repelled!
-- 🔨 [MJOLNIR'S WARD] Only the worthy may wield multiple statements!
-- 💎 Data integrity preserved by Odin's protection!
```

## 🐛 **Known Dragons - Current Limitations**

### **🔥 Major Dragons (Actively Being Slayed)**

- **No SELECT Support**: The all-seeing eye is still being forged
- **Single Command Only**: Multiple statements cause chaos (like Loki)
- **No Persistence**: Data vanishes when the program ends (like Ragnarök)
- **Memory Storage Only**: Everything lives in RAM's embrace

### **🐍 Minor Serpents (Future Quests)**

- Unicode symbols in names need testing (Runes are complex)
- Large dataset performance not optimized (For when armies gather)
- No transaction rollback (Mistakes echo through time)
- Limited data type support (More types coming like the seasons)

### **🗡️ Squashed Bugs (Victory Log)**

- ✅ SQL injection protection (Heimdall guards the gates)
- ✅ Case-insensitive commands (Understanding all tongues)
- ✅ Proper error messaging (Clear as Odin's wisdom)
- ✅ Memory leak fixes (No wasteful dragons)

## 🌊 **Final Words - The Skald's Ending**

*"In the beginning was the void, and from the void came data. From data came tables, and from tables came the need for a
database worthy of legend. YggraDB is that legend - a database not just for storing information, but for transforming
the mundane act of data management into an epic adventure."*

**Together, we shall build a database worthy of the gods themselves!** ⚡
