Notes



INSERT
2.62 ms avg (380 ops/sec)
0.02–11.8 ms (50K+ ops/sec optimized)
~100–500 ms (dozens/sec default)
YggraDB competitive before optimizations

~10–100 ms
YggraDB excellent performance


DDL Operations
0.01–1.48 ms range
~1–50 ms
~10–200 ms
YggraDB very strong


SELECT
Not benchmarked yet
<100 ms typical
~1–50 ms with indexes
Pending implementation

~10–100 ms
YggraDB exceptional


ALTER TABLE
0.06–0.16 ms avg
~10–100 ms
~100–1000 ms
YggraDB outstanding


Implementation Context
YggraDB

Language: Java (JVM overhead, faster development)
Architecture: Single-threaded, in-memory focused
Status: Core DDL operations complete, DML partially implemented
Missing Features:
Transactions and Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
B+ tree indexing
Memory pooling for garbage collection optimization



SQLite

Language: C (native performance)
Architecture: Embedded, file-based
Strengths: Mature, optimized, ACID-compliant

PostgresSQL

Language: C (native performance)
Architecture: Client-server, multi-process
Strengths: Full RDBMS, supports concurrency, enterprise-grade features

Performance Analysis
YggraDB Strengths

Schema Operations: CREATE, ALTER, and DROP operations are exceptionally fast (0.01–1.48 ms range).
Consistency: Low variance in performance across runs.
Architecture: Clean foundational design, promising for future optimizations.

Current Limitations

No Transaction Batching: Impacts INSERT performance significantly (2.62 ms avg).
No Indexing: SELECT performance not yet benchmarked, but expected to lag without B+ trees.
Single-Threaded: Lacks concurrency support, limiting scalability.
Java Overhead: Slower than C-based SQLite and PostgresSQL in some operations.

Expected Improvements

Batch Transactions: Could reduce INSERT times to ~0.1–0.5 ms.
B+ Tree Indexing: Will improve SELECT performance to be competitive.
Memory Pooling: Will reduce garbage collection overhead in Java.
